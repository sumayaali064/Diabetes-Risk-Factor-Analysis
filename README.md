# Diabetes Risk Factor Analysis

## Objective
The goal of this project is to identify key risk factors for diabetes, such as BMI, physical activity, age, income, and smoking status, and offer insights into how these factors contribute to early intervention and risk management.

## Data Cleaning
The dataset was first cleaned by checking for missing values in critical columns (BMI, Age, Diabetes Status). No missing values were found, so no imputation or further cleaning was required.

## Analysis
### 1. Demographics & Diabetes Prevalence
- Analyzed the distribution of diabetes status across different demographic groups, including smoker status and income levels.

### 2. BMI and Diabetes
- Calculated the average BMI for individuals with and without diabetes.

### 3. Physical Activity and Diabetes
- Explored the correlation between physical activity and diabetes prevalence.

## Key Findings
- Individuals with higher BMI are more likely to have diabetes.
- Physical activity appears to reduce the risk of diabetes.
- Smoking may be linked to higher diabetes rates.

## Conclusion
The findings suggest that addressing BMI, promoting physical activity, and reducing smoking can be effective strategies in preventing diabetes and managing at-risk populations.
