# Diabetes Risk Factor Analysis

## Objective
The goal of this project is to identify key risk factors for diabetes, such as BMI, physical activity, age, income, and smoking status. By understanding these factors, we can provide insights into early intervention and risk management for individuals at risk of diabetes.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and includes anonymized health data from individuals, including information on their BMI, smoking habits, physical activity, and diabetes status. [Link to Dataset](#)

## Data Cleaning
The dataset was first examined for missing values in critical columns, including:
- BMI
- Age
- Diabetes Status (`Diabetes_012`)
- Income

No missing values were found, and all columns were deemed fit for analysis without imputation.

## Analysis
### 1. Demographics & Diabetes Prevalence
- **Goal**: To analyze how diabetes prevalence differs based on demographic factors such as income and smoker status.
- **Key Findings**: Higher smoking rates and lower income levels were correlated with a higher prevalence of diabetes.

### 2. BMI and Diabetes
- **Goal**: To identify if there is a significant difference in BMI between those with and without diabetes.
- **Key Findings**: Individuals with diabetes had a noticeably higher average BMI compared to those without diabetes.

### 3. Physical Activity and Diabetes
- **Goal**: To explore the relationship between physical activity levels and diabetes risk.
- **Key Findings**: Individuals who engage in regular physical activity tend to have a lower risk of developing diabetes.

## Key Findings
- Higher BMI is strongly associated with an increased risk of diabetes.
- Regular physical activity appears to significantly lower the risk of diabetes.
- Smoking is correlated with higher diabetes rates.

## Conclusion
The analysis suggests that interventions focusing on weight management, promoting physical activity, and reducing smoking rates could be effective strategies for preventing diabetes and managing populations at risk. These insights can aid healthcare providers in targeting high-risk groups for early intervention.
